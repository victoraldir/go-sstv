go SSTV
=======

Encoding of images into audio using the SSTV standard (and its most popular encoding modes such as
Martin, Robot and Scottie).

Usage
-----

```go
tv := sstv.NewMartin(sstv.Martin1, &audio.Format{
  SampleRate: 41000,
  NumChannels: 1,
})

// Or for the other modes:
// sstv.NewPasokon(sstv.Pasokon3, format)
// sstv.NewRobot(sstv.Robot36, format)
// sstv.NewScottie(sstv.Scottie1, format)
// sstv.NewWrasse(sstv.WrasseSC2180, format)
// For a full list of mode constants, refer to the package documentation
```

For a full list of mode constants, refer to the [package documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/dotStart/go-sstv)

Command Line Interface
----------------------

The package includes a command line interface for testing purposes:

```sh
# Generate a Robot36 encoded image:
$ sstv-cli -r36 -sample-rate=41000 test2.png output.wav

# Generate a Scottie1 encoded image:
$ sstv-cli -s1 -sample-rate=41000 test2.png output.wav

# Display all modes:
$ sstv-cli -help
```

Sample decoded
-----

To decode, you can use the Android app Robot36 or QSSTV on Linux. The following is a sample image of a Robot36 encoded image decoded using the Android app Robot36:
